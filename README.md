# YoutubeSearchToJson

## What is this ?

This is an alternative to youtube search API based on the web-scraping tools named Puppeteer.

## How does it works

You just have to call it in your shell with your node.js with the text of your search as an argument
<br>
### Example :
```PS
node ytapi 'Search argument'
```
Be careful with the space in your search string if you don't put it between quotes.
<br>
It returns a json file with the title of the video, the name of the channel, the link of the video and the thumbnail.

You have an example of the `output.json` file in the git.
